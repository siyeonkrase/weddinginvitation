This project was originally created as a **real wedding invitation website**
and actively used by real-world guests.

For portfolio and public showcase purposes, the current version has been
**anonymized**. All names, photos, dates, and locations shown here are
placeholders or modified to protect personal privacy.

The project is based on an open-source wedding invitation template by  
**Daeng Muhammad Feisal** (MIT License).

I customized and extended the original template with the following improvements:

- Implemented automatic language detection (Korean / English) based on user device settings
- Built a language-aware UI where text and components dynamically adapt to the selected locale
- Integrated a direct RSVP flow via Google Forms to streamline guest responses
- Reworked layout and content hierarchy for bilingual clarity across devices
- Enhanced overall UX with a mobile-first approach for non-technical end users
