## About This Project

This project is based on an open-source wedding invitation template by  
**Daeng Muhammad Feisal** (MIT License).

I customized and extended the original template with:
- Content restructuring and layout adjustments
- Design and styling modifications
- Animation and interaction tweaks
- Deployment via GitHub Pages

Original project credit is preserved according to the MIT License.
