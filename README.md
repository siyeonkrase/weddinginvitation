This project is based on an open-source wedding invitation template by  
**Daeng Muhammad Feisal** (MIT License).

I customized and extended the original template with:
- Implemented automatic language detection (Korean / English) based on user device settings
- Built a language-aware UI where text and components dynamically adapt to the selected locale
- Integrated a direct RSVP flow via Google Forms to streamline guest responses
- Adjusted layout and content structure to ensure clarity across languages and devices
- Enhanced overall UX for mobile-first usage, considering non-technical end users

Original project credit is preserved according to the MIT License.
